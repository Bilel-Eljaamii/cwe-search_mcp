## Overview

The CWE Search MCP provides a robust Python implementation for interacting with MITRE's Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database through its official API. Designed for security researchers, developers, and vulnerability analysts, this mcp enables efficient querying of vulnerability information and integrates seamlessly with MCP-compatible systems using stdio transport.

This solution solves the problem of fragmented vulnerability research by providing a unified interface to:

- Retrieve detailed CWE information programmatically
- Explore vulnerability relationships and hierarchies
- Integrate CWE data into security tooling and workflows
- Automate vulnerability analysis and reporting

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Lookup**: Retrieve detailed information by CWE ID
- **Intelligent Search**: Find vulnerabilities by keyword across descriptions
- **Taxonomy Navigation**: Explore CWE categories and views
- **Relationship Mapping**:
  - Parent/child vulnerability relationships
  - Full ancestor/descendant hierarchies
  - View-filtered relationship analysis
- **Automatic Normalization**: Handles CWE IDs with or without "CWE-" prefix
- **Zero Configuration**: No authentication required for MITRE's public API
- **MCP Integration**: Ready for stdio transport with MCP-compatible systems
- **Batch Processing**: Retrieve multiple vulnerabilities in single requests

## Implemented API Endpoints

The mcp implements the following MITRE CWE API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/cwe/version` | Get CWE content version information |
| `/cwe/{id}` | Retrieve metadata for specified CWE ID(s) |
| `/weakness/{id(s)}` | Get weaknesses by ID(s) or all weaknesses |
| `/cwe/category/{id(s)}` | Retrieve categories by ID(s) or all categories |
| `/cwe/view/{id(s)}` | Get views by ID(s) or all views |
| `/cwe/{id}/parents` | Get parents of a weakness (view-filtered) |
| `/cwe/{id}/children` | Get children of a weakness (view-filtered) |
| `/cwe/{id}/ancestors` | Get ancestors of a weakness (view-filtered) |
| `/cwe/{id}/descendants` | Get descendants of a weakness (view-filtered) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- uv package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilel-Eljaamii/cwe-search_mcp.git
   cd cwe-search_mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install requests fast-mcp
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Standalone Execution

Run the mcp as a standalone module:

```bash
DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true mcp dev main.py
```
Output:
``` js
[06/28/25 12:46:09] INFO     Starting cwe-search_mcp

### MCP Client Integration
To integrate the CWE Search Service with your MCP client:

1. Locate Configuration: Open your MCP client configuration file

2. Update Path: Set CWE_SEARCH_SERVICE_PATH to the absolute path of your local installation directory

3. Add to your mcp client configuration file, modify the 3.`"CWE_SEARCH_SERVICE_PATH"` as you self dir.

```json
"cwe-search_mcp": {
  "autoApprove": [],
  "disabled": false,
  "timeout": 60,
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "uv",
  "args": [
    "--directory",
    "CWE_SEARCH_SERVICE_PATH",
    "run",
    "main.py"
  ]
}
```

Example API calls using Python:

```python
from cwe_search import get_cwe_info, search_cwe_by_keyword

# Get CWE-79 details
cwe_79 = get_cwe_info("79")

# Get multiple CWEs
multiple_cwes = get_cwe_info("79,89,CWE-125")

# Search for SQL-related vulnerabilities
sql_vulns = search_cwe_by_keyword("SQL injection", max_results=10)

# Get vulnerability ancestors
ancestors = get_cwe_ancestors("89", view="1000")
```

### MCP Integration

The mcp uses stdio transport for seamless integration with MCP-compatible systems:

1. **Start the mcp**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Send MCP-formatted requests** via stdin

Example MCP request:

```json
{
  "function": "get_cwe_info",
  "params": {"ids": "79,89"},
  "id": "request-123"
}
```

Example MCP response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "79": { /* CWE-79 data */ },
    "89": { /* CWE-89 data */ }
  },
  "id": "request-123"
}
```

### Key Notes

- **Authentication**: No credentials required - MITRE's CWE API is publicly accessible
- **Input Normalization**: MCP automatically handles CWE ID formats:
  - `79` ‚Üí Normalized to `79`
  - `CWE-79` ‚Üí Normalized to `79`
  - `cwe79` ‚Üí Normalized to `79`
- **Batch Processing**: Comma-separated IDs supported for most endpoints
- **`all` Keyword**: Retrieve all items for weakness, category, and view endpoints

## Dependencies
